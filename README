# s.Dog Responsive YouTube Embed shortcode

## What the project does
Creates a Wordpess shortcode [sdog-youtube-embed src=""], where the src attribute is the URL of a YouTube video.  

## Why the project is useful
Copy an embed snippet from under a YouTube video (click Share > Embed), paste that into a Wordpress page / post and it won't be responsive out of the box.
To deal with that, add the shortcode above (into a shortcode block, if you have the new block editor enabled), and paste the URL of the video into its src attribute.
**Note:** make sure you copy the url with an /embed/ path, e.g. https://www.youtube.com/embed/DN6WTr9S6Rw otherwise your browser may throw an error.
The plugin stylsheet will make the resulting HTML responsive. [Credit where credit's due] (https://themeskills.com/make-embedded-youtube-videos-responsive-wordpress/) on the CSS.
